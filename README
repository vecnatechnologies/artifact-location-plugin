About
=======

This Maven plugin finds artifacts' "physical" locations based on their groupId and artifactId.

Usage
=======

Let's say you have a project that depends on an artifact with coordinates org.group:dependency and you want to expose the location of the artifact (in your local repository) to another plugin.
By adding the plugin configuration below, you will expose the location of the artifact (YOUR_MAVEN_REPO/org/group/dependency/VERSION/dependency-VERSION.jar) as ${dependencyLocation} 
to all plugin executions in subsequent phases.

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.vecna</groupId>
  <artifactId>artifact-location-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.2</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>default-compile</id>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>execute</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <artifacts>
          <property>
            <name>org.group:dependency</name>
            <value>dependencyLocation</value>
          </property>
        </artifacts>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>

Note that multiple artifacts can be specified and mapped to different project properties.
